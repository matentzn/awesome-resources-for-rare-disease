# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome Resources for Rare Disease!

## Adding a Resource

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **Search previous suggestions** before making a new one to avoid duplicates.
- **Make an individual pull request** for each suggestion.
- **Use the following format:** `- [Resource Name](URL) - Brief description.`
- **Descriptions should be concise** and explain what the resource is, not just the name.
- Descriptions should end with a period.
- **Check your spelling and grammar.**
- **New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.**
- **The pull request and commit should have a useful title.**

## Quality Standards

Resources should be:

- **Actively maintained** - Resources that are no longer updated should be noted or removed.
- **Relevant** to the rare disease community (researchers, clinicians, patients, advocates).
- **Freely accessible** or at least have a free tier for basic access.
- **Reputable** - from established organizations, research institutions, or well-maintained projects.

## Updating Your Pull Request

If asked to update your pull request, please edit your PR directly rather than opening a new one.

Thank you for your contributions!
